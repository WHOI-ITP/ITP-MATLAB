# ITP-MATLAB
The Ice Tethered Profiler is an autonomous instrument that vertically profiles the water column under sea ice. The ITP collects measurements of conductivity, temperature, and depth. Data are automatically transmitted back via satellite.  [Learn More](http://www.whoi.edu/itp "Learn More")

## Motivation
To date, 110 ITP systems have been deployed, and more than 110000 water profiles have been collected. As these data continue to accumulate, and the number of users working with the data increases, the need has become apparent for a set of tools to access, search for, and manipulate ITP data.

## Features
  - Easily and rapidly read from all available ITP profiles
  - Search profiles based on
    - latitude range
    - longitude range
    - date range
    - pressure range
    - system number
  - Profiles are returned as a MATLAB structured array
